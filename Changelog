  - Made "test lyrics" button reload lyrics without restarting the song (thx Dario Abatianni)
  - Fixed compilating using modern FFmpeg

  - When exporting CDG/Video, the editor now remembers the exported CDG and video file names.
  - Added commands to change the block text vertical alignment: @%T for top, @%M for middle, @%B for bottom; thanks Dario Abatianni
  - Added highlighting for special character sequences starting with @. Patch by Dario Abatianni.

2012-02-01 gyunaev <gyunaev@ulduzsoft.com>
  - Released versio 1.3
  - Audio player switched to FFMpeg/SDL instead of incredibly buggy and unreliable Phonon. No more “cannot play this file” error on Win32.
  - Added improved export in CD+G format with a preview dialog and easily configurable options.
  - Improved the CD+G tester which allows playing any CD+G file, not only the one generated internally. Therefore it is now possible to do several exports, test them all and see which one would suit you the best.
  - Added support for the video and image backgrounds (Edit/Insert picture and Edit/Insert video). Any lyrics can use multiple backgrounds, which will be switched at specified times. Note that all existing lyrics formats are based on text and do not support backgrounds (it will be ignored when exporting to, for example, LRC format). Therefore it is only relevant for CD+G and video export.
  - Added support for video export. You can now export your Karaoke song together with music, lyrics and the background into a video file!
  - Numerous improvements and bugfixes.
